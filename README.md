# 🌍 Earthquake Data Analysis using USGS API

## 📌 Project Overview
This project retrieves real-time and historical earthquake data from the **USGS Earthquake Catalog API** and analyzes trends in seismic activity. Using **Python**, we fetch, clean, and visualize earthquake data based on parameters like **date range, magnitude, depth, and location**.

## 🔗 API Source
The dataset is dynamically retrieved from the **[USGS Earthquake Catalog API](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/)**, which provides access to recorded seismic events worldwide.

## 🚀 Features
- **Fetch real-time earthquake data** from the USGS API.
- **Data preprocessing** to clean and structure earthquake data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to identify trends in seismic activity.
- **Visualization of earthquake distribution** using interactive maps.
- **Statistical analysis of earthquake magnitude and frequency**.

## 🗂 Dataset
The dataset retrieved from the API includes:
- **Time:** Timestamp of the earthquake.
- **Magnitude:** The strength of the earthquake.
- **Location:** Latitude and longitude of the event.
- **Depth:** How deep the earthquake occurred.
- **Place:** Textual description of the location.
- **Tsunami Indicator:** Whether the earthquake caused a tsunami.

## The most earthquake-prone regions were identified.
## Correlations between magnitude and depth were explored.
## Seasonal trends in earthquake activity were analyzed.
